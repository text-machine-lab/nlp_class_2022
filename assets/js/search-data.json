            "content": "If you already have anaconda/conda/miniconda/conda-forge, proceed to step 7. . Step 1. Download conda installer. . wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh . NOTE 1a: if this fails with “wget: command not found” install wget via “sudo apt install wget” (Ubuntu) or “brew install wget” (MacOS). Then try to do step 1 again. . NOTE 1b: alternatively, you can just follow the link above using your browser and download the file this way. . Step 2. Install miniconda. . bash ~/miniconda.sh . Step 3. Read and accept all licences. Step 4. When asked where to install conda, just press enter to install it in the default directory. Step 5. IMPORTANT: Then it will ask you “Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3”. Type “yes” and press enter. Step 6. IMPORTANT: Restart your terminal session – open and close your terminal window. . NOTE: If you don’t want conda to start base envorinment in every terminal you open, you can execute conda config --set auto_activate_base false. . Step 7. Create a new environment nlp_class with python 3.7. . conda create --name nlp_class python=3.7 . NOTE: If you have conda not found error, it might mean you skipped step 5 and now need to add conda to your PATH manually. It it easy to do, here’s a solution. . Step 8. Activate this environment. . conda activate nlp_class . Step 9. Install required libraries. . (Updated Jan 25, added ipywidgets that is required for datasets widgets to work inside jupyter lab.) . python -m pip install jupyterlab torch transformers datasets scikit-learn ipywidgets . Step 10. Install a new kernel to a jupyter lab. . python -m ipykernel install --name nlp_class --user . (Updated Jan 27, added --user option to the commend which resolves /usr/local/share permission denied issue some students had) . NOTE: If step 10 fails, ask Vlad for help. . Step 11. Launch jupyter lab. . jupyter lab . This should open a browser tab with Jupyter Lab running. . Step 12. On the right, you will see a couple of available notebook enviornments under “Notebook” title. Select “nlp_class” and create a new notebook. . Step 13. Make sure all imports work. To do this execute the following code. . import torch import sklearn import transformers import datasets . If this fails, ask Vlad for help. . Now you should be good to go. If you are wondering why we need conda and environments, you can read this blogpost. .",
